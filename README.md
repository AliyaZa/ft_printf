----

## Introduction
At 42_Network schools - Including 1337-, students are not allowed to use library functions.
so we re-write our own functions, and printf is one of must have functions, so we write our own.

## How To Use
1. clone this repo.
2. run the `make` command.
3. include the header files.
4. call by ft_printf, and use just as you gonna use the normal printf.
ps : this project is only tested in MAC os, I don't know it's behavios in other os.

## What ft_printf supports:
- the conversions : `c`, `s`, `p`, `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, `X`.
- Manages : `%%` (with the width and all the other flags.)
- the flags :  `#`, `0`, `-`, `+`, `space`, `*`, `$` and `'`.
- the minimum field-width
- the precision.
